# Smart Heatpumps HA (HomeAssistant)

## Intro
This github repository is actually a **WORK IN PROGRESS**, it will be regularly updated based on my tests and is made based on my specific home setup.
I hope it will help other people in the same situation as mine.

Any hint, suggestion or comment on the *Discussion* page is really appreciated.

You can also follow the updates from the community on the official HomeAssistant forum here: [Forum Discussion](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/transform-my-heatpumps-into-smart-heatpumps-with-solar/488002)
