# Roadmap

## November 2022 - Start
Version 1.0 is out.

Heatpumps are correctly working, i can comfortly heat my house "for free" by day, using radiators only during evening hours.

### What to improve
- Start the heatpump with more offset from the goal temperature and not the coolest
- Stop the heatpump closest to goal temperature and not the warmest
- Rename all entities to make the code more flexible (e.g. use *input_text* rather than writing names into automations)
- Re-write all in python
- Create an add-on
- User filtered temperature sensor to improve comfort
